## Assignment 1:
I fitted the age distribution of a sample of citibike riders to normal and log-normal curves, and used a variety of goodness-of-fit tests to make conclusions about whether or not the age distributions truly followd the assumed underlying distributions. For EXTRA CREDIT, I first split the age data but NYC borough, and performed a similar analysis.

## Assignment 2:
I used american census data to study the gender gap in wage/income across a range of races. I used linear regression

## Assignment 3
#### Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
+ Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.
+ NULL: The average weight difference for a group of test subjects that adhered to a controlled diet (but no regimented exercise), from before to after the diet, is the same or less than that of a test group that adhered to a exercise regimen, but no forced diet plan. Weight GAINS would be handled appropriately,  
+ H_0: WeightLoss_diet <= WeightLoss_exercise

#### Do American trust the president?
+ POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.
+ NULL: 50% or more of polled individuals do not trust Bill Clinton as a President.
+ H_0: count_dont_trust >= count_do trust 

#### Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
+ Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.
+ NULL: The smoking cessation rate for the group of smokers wearing real nicotine patches is lower than, or equal to, that of a group of smokers who are given placebo nictine patches.
+ H_0: cessation_real <= cessation_placebo

#### Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
+ Experimental setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.
+ NULL: The average IQ for children at a fixed age (choose 1, 2, 3, 4, or some aggregate measure) whose mothers smoked regularly during pregnancy is the same or greater than that of a group of children whose mothers did not smoke during pregnancy.
+ H_0: IQ_smokingmoms >= IQ_nonsmoking moms

#### A note on group work:
I receieved some help from Jordan Vani on the data munging aspect of assignment 2. I thoroughly reviewed all three assignments (after giving them a try myself) with Jonathan Pichot.
