## Assignment 1:
The markdown file 'CitibikeReview_iw453.md' located in this HW4 repo is a copy of the markdown file that I submitted as a pull request to Kristi Korsberg's citibike project repo. I provided Kristi with feedback on the setup of her citibike research project.

## Assignment 2:
I summarized two scientific papers, picking out variable types, statistical tests, and research questions, as shown in the table below.

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **| 
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
t-test	| 1, whether or not guppies were trained to distinguish between numbers  | categorical/dichotomous | 1, amount of time spent in preference area | continuous | different phases of experiment controlled for different things: continuous stimuli or numerical stimuli held constant for fish | 	continuous + categorical | Can newborn guppies discriminate among large quantities? | The tendancy for newborn guppies' to recognize larger numbers over smaller numbers in a two-option decision (for food reward) is no greater than a random selection between the two options.  | 0.05 | [Large Number Discrimination in Newborn Fish](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062466.PDF)|
 Spearman Correlation |transcriptional profile (one of the possibly correlated variables)|continuous|pathway profile (the other of the possibly correlated variables)|continuous|gene expression profiles were normalized around median across all samples (some measure of offset being the controlled variable)|continuous|Do cancer subtypes with similar phenotype, or similar clinical outcome, show correlation at a molecular level?|The correlation of molecular properties in cancer subtypes with similar phenotype is not present; ie there is no relationship. |0.05 |[Correlation Analysis Connects Cancer Subtypes](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069747#s5)|
 
## Assignment 3:
For this assignment, I followed along with a skeleton notebook created by Frederica 'effectivenes of NYC Post-Prison Employment Programs.ipynb' and completed the unfinished sections as required. I used a z-test and a chi-squared test to assess teh signifiance of the impact of NYC's CEO post-prison employment program.

## Assignment 4:
Again, I was following along with Frederica's skeleton notebook for this assignment. I used three different statistical tests for correlation (KS, Pearson, and Spearman) to test whether the distribution of age among both male and female citibike riders was similar (or the same). For extra credit, I performed a similar analysis, but was looking at day riders vs. night riders, instead of gender.

## A note on group work:
