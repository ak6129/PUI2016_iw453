### Assignment 1

In assignment 1, I visualized the Central Limit Theorem using a variety of random distributions and sample sizes. Further explanation and method within the notebook. Plots are rendered within the notebook.

### Assignment 2

For assignment 2, Jonathan Pichot and I started a statistical analysis on the demand for citibike zone expansion in mid/north Manhattan. We collected, processed, and visualized our datasets. The analysis will be completed in the next assignment.

DISCLAIMER OF GROUP WORK:
I worked closely with Jonathan Pichot (jp4772) on Assignment 2.
My contributions:
  - reading in citibike station data
  - plotting
Jonathan's contributions:
  - GIS work/inspection
  - reading in citbike trip data
Together:
  - formulation and refinement tof hypotheses
  - categorization of trips
  - basic analysis (means, distributions, ect)

#### We are sharing the final script - it will be identical for both of us.

### Assignment 3

In assignment 3, I completed the lab exercise from class. We proved that we can reject the null hypothesis (new MTA bus route has no effect on commute time) based on a standard Z-test. Further explanation and method within the notebook.
